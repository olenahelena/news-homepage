## Overview

I am happy to finish this challenge! I thought I will finish it faster, but I stuck on the JavaScript part. Also I had troubles with appearing of nav bar.
I can see where I can improve my code and I can't wait for the next challenge. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about JavaScript function. Because, it's still hard to understand some concepts. I also want to learn how to make navigation bar with more complicated animation. 

### Useful resources
